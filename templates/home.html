      <p>
         I discovered the transformative power of yoga during a time <br>
         of personal exploration.Drawn to its holistic approach, <br>
         I embraced yoga not just as a physical practice but as a journey of self-awareness.<br>
         My yoga mat became my sanctuary, a space where I could connect with my breath, <br>
         find balance, and nurture both my body and mind.<br>

         My approach to teaching is rooted in creating a supportive and inclusive space. <br>
         I believe that yoga is for everyone, regardless of age, flexibility, or experience. <br>
         Together, we'll explore the foundations of yoga, celebrate progress over perfection, <br>
         and build a community that embraces each individual's unique journey. <br>
